      "The art world is a challenging dimension to enter and understand: the space of what can be defined as art has widened incredibly in the last decades, and, as with almost everything else, the pace at which it’s progressing has left many people behind. The technical language to describe it has evolved, including sciences, philosophy, and several other very complex categories, but its often misuse creates even more considerable confusion among the general public.",
      "Artioma exists with this phenomenon in mind. It tries to create a satire of the art jargon while simultaneously creating a platform that people can use to interface themselves directly with works of different art universities to better understand the plethora of languages inside them; its function is to critique and teach.",
      "Peter Gelderloos, an American anarchist and activist, in his 2003 article Elitist Language, makes a compelling argument, which serves as the basis of our project: <br><i>'We should use the forms of language we’re comfortable with, academic or otherwise, as long as we do it lucidly, in a way that invites learning and sharing of that knowledge. [...] (We have to) Recognize the variety of languages, but upset the economic, racial, and gendered hierarchy in which these languages have been placed.'</i>",
      "Our final objective is to help the general public understand the modern art industry by analyzing the projects of the new generation of university artists. We showcase contemporary art using a platform that the universities can use to understand the challenges of writing about art in an accessible way, hopefully encouraging students to do so."
